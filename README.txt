REQUIREMENTS:
- A legally obtained ROM of Super Smash Brothers for N64.

STEPS:
- use xdelta to apply the patch to your ROM.

WHAT IS THIS?: 
- This mod replaces Fox's skin with Berdly from Toby Fox's game, DELTARUNE.
- Berdly does not use guns so I gave him potassium as a compromise
- His shine is also replaced with a neat graphic!
